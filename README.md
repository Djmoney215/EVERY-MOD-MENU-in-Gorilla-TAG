# EVERY-MOD-MENU-in-Gorilla-TAG
This hold EVERY SINGLE MOD MENU in Gorilla Tag!

All you have to do is download the mod menu's is to go to realeses and download the zip file. Make sure you extract the zip file!
Then, just look through all of the mod menu's and when you find one you want. Drag the .dll file to your plugins folder in your gorilla tag folder.

I have put in suggested mod menu's that I think you should try in a folder for you!

Just put in a hopefully working zoloz admin menu. Probably wont work, if it does let me know on my discord if you can.
My discord is JoePapi#0770
