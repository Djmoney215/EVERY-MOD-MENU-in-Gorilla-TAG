# EVERY-MOD-MENU-in-Gorilla-TAG
This hold EVERY SINGLE MOD MENU in Gorilla Tag!

All you have to do is download the mod menu's is to go to realeses and download the zip file. Make sure you extract the zip file!
Then, just look through all of the mod menu's and when you find one you want. Drag the .dll file to your plugins folder in your gorilla tag folder.

I have put in suggested mod menu's that I think you should try in a folder for you!

Just got Displayy Mod menu V5, I will put it in releases and above this readme area. It has kick gun, break gamemode, lag server/break rig, and all of that jazz so have fun!
Just remember lag server/breakrig can get you banned instantly even in a private!
